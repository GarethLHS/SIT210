= Project: Portable battery operated solar watering system

The project that I have chosen to  complete is an automated watering system that is portable battery operated and solar charging balcony watering system for people who want a beautiful tranquil balcony garden without having to spend hours on the balcony maintaining a garden.

This project should be suitable for the elderly, renters or people who travel and don’t want to sped each day looking after a balcony garden.
