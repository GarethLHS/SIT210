= Project: Portable battery operated solar watering system

The project that I have chosen to  complete is an automated watering system that is portable battery operated and solar charging balcony watering system for people who want a beautiful tranquil balcony garden without having to spend hours on the balcony maintaining a garden.

This project should be suitable for the elderly, renters or people who travel and donâ€™t want to sped each day looking after a balcony garden.
 
* This project has been built from Debian Lunix and all commands are for configuring this project from a Debian Linux host. *

|===


Connect LED the Negative leg of your LED to 220Ohm resister 
connect 220Ohm resister to ground
connect LED Positive(anode) leg (longer leg) to GPIO Pin 21

from the CLI console of your RaspberryPi run the following commands

....
$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

$ sudo apt-get install python3 git wget

$ python3 -m venv indicator

$ source indicator/bin/activate

$ pip install paho.mqtt

$ pip install RPi.GPIO

$ wget https://github.com/GarethLHS/SIT210/blob/main/Task11.1HD-Final_Project/final_project_watering_system/RaspberryPi/balcony_wateringMQTT.py

....

You will need to use your favorite editor nedit, pico, vim to edit your mqtt settings that you will subscribe to from thinkspeak.com

Follow the code below to run your Raspberry code
....
$ python3 ./balcony_wateringMQTT.py

*Download Arduino IDE from arduino.cc*
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Configure your Arduino for IoT cloud add your device onto IoT cloud. This will make configuring your Arduino and ensure you have updated SSL root certificates if required.

Once you are running the Arduino IDE you can open the final_project_watering_system.ino, arduino_secrets.h and thingsProperties.h files confiure for your network by changeing the SSID and credentials.

== Step 3: Configure ThinkSpeak WebHosting

Create an account on https://thingspeak.com
 

**ThinkSpeak database::

* field1=temp
* field2=humid
* field3=floatSwitchState
* field4=soilMoistureValue
* field5=voltage


image::Thinkspeak.png[ThinkSpeak]
image::Thinkspeak1.png[ThinkSpeak Dashboard]

*Configure MQTT hosting
Go to Devices --> MQTT --> Add new Devices --> Give it a name and select the channel you have already created --> then click Add Device

This will create your MQTT hosting you will need to copy the Client ID and credentials and put these details into your Arduino code.


== Step 4: Configure IFTTT Webhooks

You will need to configure 2 webhooks and edit they Arduino code to replace your webhook address.

== Step 5: Connect the Drip irrigation system

Connect your clear (21)Pope tubing to the water pump the other end connects to (23) Ladco hose fitting. 
This then clicks into (22) Ladco Click Poly Irrigation Tube fitting.

Now the 4mm tube gets connected to the (24) T joind then to the (25) Holman 4mm drip irrigation end that will be  spiked into your pot plant.
