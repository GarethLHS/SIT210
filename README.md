This is the code for an Arduino Uno to print my first name in Morse code.
This is for an assignment SIT210 Embedded Computer Systems at Deakin University.

Task2.1WebHook
Task 2.1P Arduino Nano 33 IoT Device: Sending Data to the Web
I used an Arduino MKR Wifi 1010 IoT Device instead of Nano 33 as the Nano was not in stock.
