# SIT210 Embedded  System Programming 
## 1_1_BlinkName.ino
This is the code for an Arduino Uno to print my first name in Morse code.
This is for an assignment SIT210 Embedded Computer Systems at Deakin University.

Things to improve 
- Use of Hashmap or Dictionary

## 2_1_WebHook.ino
Arduino Nano 33 IoT Device: Sending Data to the Web
I used an Arduino MKR Wifi 1010 IoT Device instead of Nano 33 as the Nano was not in stock.

Things to improve
- Add BH1750 light intensity sensor as I used simple Photo Transistor Light Sensor.
	- Use I2C Interface for sensor data
